# 🗺️ Much Better Map Design!

## What I Changed

You were absolutely right - the previous design was cluttered and took up too much space. I've completely redesigned it with a **minimal, professional approach**.

## 🎯 New Design Philosophy: "Clean & Focused"

### The Problem (Before):
- ❌ Large cards blocking the map
- ❌ Too many UI elements fighting for attention
- ❌ Cluttered layout with excessive padding
- ❌ Hard to focus on the actual map
- ❌ Too many gradients and visual noise

### The Solution (After):
- ✅ Minimal floating controls in corners
- ✅ Clean, simple day pills at top-center
- ✅ Single compact city bar at bottom
- ✅ Maximum map visibility
- ✅ Professional, uncluttered design
